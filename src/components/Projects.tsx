      description:
        "turbo trash is a mobile hyper-casual game aimed at teaching waste management with an eco-conscious twist. you play as a sorting robot using 'TecLev' levitation technology to grab and fling various objects into the correct bins: glass, paper, plastic, organic, and metals/e-waste. the game has a strict yet friendly boss (a voice on the speaker) encouraging you to do your best, rewarding accuracy, and penalizing mistakes by draining your energy. objects roll down an increasingly fast conveyor belt, with overtime periods intensifying the pace. you can also unlock perks and different antennas to tweak gameplay and adapt to challenges. the ultimate goal? to become 'employee of the month' and beat high scores on the leaderboard. visually, itâ€™s a mix of futuristic tech and cartoonish style, with a 'clean industrial' look, despite being set in a waste collection center.",
